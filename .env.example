# erela.js Search Platform.
#
# Default: "youtube music"
#
# Possibilities:
#     youtube music - Will prioritize the Music library provided to YouTube by Copyright Holders. Regular YouTube URLs still work in this case. There is cases where https://github.com/brblacky/lavamusic/issues/335 or https://github.com/brblacky/lavamusic/issues/343 can occur when searching. If this occurs, then switch to "youtube" can resolve the issues for you.
#     youtube - Will use all of YouTube. Age restricted content will not work unless you have an Email and Password setup for application.yml in the LavaLink Server Configuration.
#     soundcloud - Will use the SoundCloud library to search for a song. This method can cause some issues as search results can be hit or miss. It is the limitations of SoundCloud API.
SEARCH_PLATFORM="youtube music" # This option sets the Default Platform that will be used for searching and playing music through the "/play" command or typing a song name in "botname-song-request" channel.
AGGREGATED_SEARCH_ORDER="youtube music,youtube,soundcloud" # Sets the order of Slash command's AutoComplete results. Do not recommend editing this unless you know what you are doing.
